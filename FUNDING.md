# Funding

The initial funding mechanism is initially only via the UDV donation process.
The funding and amount will be published, and the funders will be publicly
acknowledged (no anonymous donors).

There should be no expectations of returns from the UDV donation process,
except that the donations and donors will be acknowledged on a timely basis.

## Funding History

The Interchain Foundation has donated to the UDV donation process.  The exact
amount will be disclosed soon.  TODO: publish link to ICF URL & pubkey.
