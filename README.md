# What is Virgo?

Virgo is the largest supercluster in Cosmos.

# The United DAOs of Virgo

The United DAOs of Virgo represent a cluster of interoperable DAOs.

DAOs that represent global (distributed) and local communities require common
protocols, software, and hardware to cooperate, especially in the context of
liquid democracy experiments.

# Seven Virgo Values

* Voluntary.
* Ecological.
* Accountable.
* Transparent.
* Secure.
* Democratic.
* Exitable.

# Motivation

We want to represent the interests of the crypto community who respect the
Virgo Values.

Through the union and partnership between these DAOs, we aim to coordinate to
solve the biggest problems that affect our community and the greater
environment in which it resides.

# Mission

Virgo's mission is to make freely available the best protocols, software, and
hardware for decentralized finance, social/communications, and advanced
governance technology.

Virgo will develop and recommend:

 * the best protocols that balance transparency and privacy the best financial
 * system for sustainable development with less systemic risk the best platform
 * for collective decision making at all scales

Virgo aims to use this new foundation to solve the world's greatest challences,
such as climate change\* and providing for basic human rights.

\* _Virgo's first environmental mandate is to create a platform for
convincing all rational minds whether climate change is or is not a man made
phenomena._

# Composition

The United DAOs of Virgo is itself a DAO that is associated with many sovereign
member DAOs, making a complex web of assocations.

Each of these DAOs are said to conform to the Virgo Protocols for
interoperability.

## Virgo Protocol

A DAO conforming to the Virgo Protocols have the following components:

* Executive
* Board
* Court
* Treasury
* Directory
  - "/" - information about the DAO.
  - "/laws" - immutable rules of the DAO, such as who can change the bylaws.
  - "/bylaws" - human-interpreted laws of the DAO and members.
  - "/committees" - (generally more restricted) DAOs associated by name.
  - "/members" - privacy preserving information about real persons; for UDV
    citizenship, some information must be public, such as ones full name.
  - "/mission" - the mission of the DAO.

### Virgo Protocol: Decision Making

The Executive is 1, 2, or 3 member persons from the Board.  Executives and
Board members are natural persons.

Membership of the Board and Executive must conform to the Board Spec which
determines the composition and number of seats.

In principle, the Executive makes day-to-day decisions, which can be overridden
by the Board based on a time-delay and circuit breaker mechanism on Proposals.

Board membership updates are passed by the passage of Proposals.

The Court (sometimes a reference to an external DAO) has veto power over the
passage of Proposals.

In some (but not all) DAOs, the proposal process and/or the membership of the
Court is partially controlled by a liquid and direct democracy voting system of
a broader body of members.  For example, the UDV Supreme Court as well as the
UDV proposal process is partially controlled by the deduplicated unique members
of the UDV.

## UDV Core Members

TODO define default tax interface for State DAOs.

#### UDV Citizens

The UDV Congress defines a citizenry of the UDV.

Each State DAOs are responsible for maintaining the privacy of its members.

The UDV Congress is responsible for ensuring that one natural person gets one
vote.

Protocol (IDAO/DAP).
