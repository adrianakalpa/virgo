# What is Virgo?

Virgo is the largest supercluster in Cosmos.

# The United DAOs of Virgo

The United DAOs of Virgo represent a cluster of interoperable DAOs.

DAOs that represent global (distributed) and local communities require common
protocols, software, and hardware to cooperate, especially in the context of
liquid democracy experiments.

# Seven Virgo Values

* Voluntary.
* Ecological.
* Accountable.
* Transparent.
* Secure.
* Democratic.
* Exitable.

# Motivation

We want to represent the interests of the crypto community who respect the
Virgo Values.

Through the union and partnership between these DAOs, we aim to coordinate to
solve the biggest problems that affect our community and the greater
environment in which it resides.

# Mission

Virgo's mission is to make freely available the best protocols, software, and
hardware for decentralized finance, social/communications, and advanced
governance technology.

Virgo will develop and recommend:

 * the best protocols that balance transparency and privacy the best financial
 * system for sustainable development with less systemic risk the best platform
 * for collective decision making at all scales

Virgo aims to use this new foundation to solve the world's greatest challences,
such as climate change\* and providing for basic human rights.

\* _Virgo's first environmental mandate is to create a platform for
convincing all rational minds whether climate change is or is not a man made
phenomena._

# Composition

The United DAOs of Virgo is itself a DAO that is associated with many sovereign
member DAOs, making a complex web of assocations.

Each of these DAOs are said to conform to the Virgo Protocols for
interoperability.

## Virgo Protocol

A DAO conforming to the Virgo Protocols have the following components:

* Executive (optional)
* Board (optional)
* Owners
* Court (optional)
* Treasury (optional)
* Directory
  - "/README" - information about the DAO.
  - "/BOARD" - information about the board & executive(s).
  - "/LAWS" - specification of DAO composition, such as the composition of the Board (if any), or how the BYLAWS are updated.
  - "/BYLAWS" - rules that apply to the board members, executives, and owners, and are interpreted by the court.
  - "/COMMITTEES" - lightweight DAOs associated by name.
  - "/OWNERS" - privacy preserving information about real persons or entities that have collective control over this DAO.
  - "/MISSION" - the mission of the DAO.
  
Owners are natural persons or entities (such as a corporation or a DAO like the Cosmos Hub),
and ownership can be weighted differently or equally (democratic).
The Board and Executive are also composed of natural persons or entities.
Members of the Board or Executive each get 1 vote in their respective groups. 

The Executive is composed of 1, 2, or 3 members.
The Board and Owners may be composed of any number of members.

Membership of the Board and Executive must conform to the Board Spec which
determines the number of seats and composition of each.

In the UDV (which is itself a DAO), the real-person owners across the DAOs and
sub-DAOs are de-duplicated according to the laws of UDV Citizenship, and are
collectively called the Citizens of the UDV.

### Virgo Protocol: Decision Making

Decisions are made by the passage of Proposals.

In principle, the Executive makes day-to-day decisions, which can be overridden
by the Board based on time restrictions and veto mechanisms.  Likewise, the Owners
can override the Executive and Board.  Generally, the Executive and Board
if present serve the Owners of the DAO.

Board and Executive membership updates are also decided by the passage of Proposals.

The Court (sometimes a reference to an external DAO) has veto power over the
passage of Proposals.

The proposal process and/or the Court (or the membership of the Court)
are partially controlled by a liquid and direct democracy voting system of
the Owners.

The UDV has Citizens instead of Owners.  The UDV Supreme Court as well as the
UDV proposal process are partially controlled by the Citizens of the UDV.

## UDV Core Members

These member DAOs of the UDV are core to the composition of the UDV.

* Virgo Finance
  - Virgo Cash
  - Virgo Exchange
  - Virgo Custody
  - Virgo Regulations
  - Virgo Scaling and Interop
  - Virgo Economics

### UDV Congress

The UDV Congress is composed of member DAOs called State DAOs, and a citizenry
composed of the members of the State DAOs of the UDV Congress.

NOTE no representation without taxation.
TODO define default tax interface for State DAOs.

#### UDV Citizens

The UDV Congress defines a citizenry of the UDV.

Each State DAOs are responsible for maintaining the privacy of its members.

The UDV Congress is responsible for ensuring that one natural person gets one
vote.

The UDV Congress and the member State DAOs speak the InterDAO Directory Access
Protocol (IDAO/DAP).
