# What is Virgo?


## Virgo is an IDEA

"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes
its laws!" - Mayer Amschel Rothschild

"If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction
of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” - Sir David Attenborough

Our social-communications/financial/governance systems must be designed to help
us coordinate better to solve the world's biggest challenges.

Virgo is an open association of individuals and organizations working together
to create better open tools for coordination at all scales.

We believe that global coordination tools can be made by following the virtues
of openness, accountability, stemming from a kind of radical transparency; and
by drawing from lessons from history of our financial and socialogical systems.


## Virgo is a BRAND

"The European Commission is "currently investigating potential anti-competitive
behavior" related to the Libra Association amid concerns the proposed payment
system would unfairly shut out rivals, the EU authority said in a questionnaire
sent out earlier this month." - Bloomberg 2019-08-20

"In mythology a Libra is related to the Greek Goddess of Justice, Themis, the
Greek mythology version of Atalanta (meaning balanced), and Astraea (daughter
of Themis), who went up to heaven and became the constellation of Virgo, and
carried the scales of justice, which is the constellation Libra." - Wikipedia

Bitcoin is the IDEA and BRAND of decentralized transparent accountable Money.
Facebook-Libra is a BRAND of an industry managed Money.
Open-Libra is the IDEA of decentralized transparent accountable Finance.
Virgo is a IDEA and BRAND of decentralized transparent accountable Human Coordination.

Virgo as a BRAND is managed by a DAO called the United DAOs of Virgo, or UDV
for short.

technology.  The UDV aims to use this new foundation to help solve the world's
greatest challenges, such as preventing catastrophic climate change and
environmental destruction, and providing for basic human needs for members
across the globe.

## UDV Composition

The United DAOs of Virgo is itself a DAO that is associated with many sovereign
member DAOs, making a complex web of assocations.

Each of these DAOs are said to conform to the United DAOs Protocols for 
interoperability.


## United DAOs Protocol

A DAO conforming to the United DAOs Protocols have the following components:

* Executive (optional)
* Board (optional)
* Owners
* Court (optional)
* Treasury (optional)
* Directory
  - "/README" - information about the DAO.
  - "/BOARD" - information about the board & executive(s).
  - "/LAWS" - specification of DAO composition, such as the composition of the Board (if any), or how the BYLAWS are updated.
  - "/BYLAWS" - rules that apply to the board members, executives, and owners, and are interpreted by the court.
  - "/COMMITTEES" - lightweight DAOs associated by name.
  - "/OWNERS" - privacy preserving information about real persons or entities that have collective control over this DAO.
  - "/MISSION" - the mission of the DAO.
  
Owners are natural persons or entities (such as a corporation or a DAO like the
Cosmos Hub), and ownership can be weighted differently or equally (democratic).
The Board and Executive are also composed of natural persons or entities.
Members of the Board or Executive each get 1 vote in their respective groups. 

The Executive is composed of 1, 2, or 3 members.  The Board and Owners may be
composed of any number of members.

Membership of the Board and Executive must conform to the Board Spec which
determines the number of seats and composition of each.

NOTE: In the UDV (which is itself a DAO), the real-person owners across the
DAOs and sub-DAOs are de-duplicated according to the laws of UDV Citizenship,
and are collectively called the Citizens of the UDV.

### United DAOs Protocol: Decision Making

Decisions are made by the passage of Proposals.

In principle, the Executive makes day-to-day decisions, which can be overridden
by the Board based on time restrictions and veto mechanisms.  Likewise, the Owners
can override the Executive and Board.  Generally, the Executive and Board
if present serve the Owners of the DAO.

Board and Executive membership updates are also decided by the passage of Proposals.

The Court (sometimes a reference to an external DAO) has veto power over the
passage of Proposals.

The proposal process and/or the Court (or the membership of the Court)
are partially controlled by a liquid and direct democracy voting system of
the Owners.

NOTE: The UDV has Citizens instead of Owners.  The UDV Supreme Court as well as
the UDV proposal process are partially controlled by the Citizens of the UDV.
