#`Mission

* Answer the question, "What multicurrency monetary system should we be designing for?"

Such a system should be transparent, secure, scalable, balance the needs of
privacy vs anti-money laundering, and designed to be provably stable with
minimal risk of systemic failure, and designed to incentivize the investment
into the local ecosystems and common infrastructures.

## Unsorted Questions

* How can the USD, the Euro, and SDRs be improved?
* How can we incentivize partnership (mutual success & failure) of local communities?
* How should we think about the category of currencies?  Industry (e.g. Libra) vs Geographical/State (e.g. USD, Euro)?
