* Each DAO needs a Board and Board Spec.

* The Virgo Stack which runs the Virgo Protocols, which is also what the UDV
  zone runs on, is designed to be easy to fork into new super DAOs or local
regional DAOs.

* Using Virgo, any state, municipality, or industry consortium can streamline
  the the creation of associated members or sub-bodies, with automated
membership fee payment or tax payment.

* The United DAOs of Virgo (UDV) can be thought of as a federation of DAOs
  that are collectively paying for the common good such as common protocol and
infrastructure.  Along the way, the UDV also has the mission to create a common
platform for liquid democracy across the "citizens" of the UDV, by creating a
privacy-preserving cross-DAO identity system.

* A simple use-case of a DAO is for a state or municipality to manage the
  direction and funding of lightweight councils/committees.
