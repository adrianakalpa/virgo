# Empowering humanity to make an impact

The internet has created wonderful ways to make connections across the world. But today's social networks are centrally owned, wield enormous influence, and bombarded us daily fake news. There are ways today to drive awareness of global issues that affect all of humanity. But awareness is not action. Individual humans still lack the agency and the leverage to improve the world on a massive scale.

Virgo is the answer. Itâ€™s a movement and a community that empowers humanity to weigh in together on tragedies of the commons, crowdfunds solutions, and keeps funded companies accountable through transparent blockchain governance.
