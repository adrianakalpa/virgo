# What is Virgo?

## Virgo is an IDEA

"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes
its laws!" - Mayer Amschel Rothschild

"If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction
of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” - Sir David Attenborough

Our social-communications/financial/governance systems must be designed to help
us coordinate better to solve the world's biggest challenges.

Virgo is an open association of individuals and organizations working together
to create better open tools for coordination at all scales.

We believe that global coordination tools can be made by following the virtues
of openness and accountability, stemming from a kind of radical transparency; and
by drawing from lessons from history of our financial and sociological systems.

## Virgo is a BRAND

"In mythology, a Libra is related to the Greek Goddess of Justice, Themis, the
