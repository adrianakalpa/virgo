# Virgo video script

We are surrounded by fire.

When you follow the news, you find that there is little hope for our future.

We are dealing with a set of unfolding tragedies. A deteriorating environment, a rapidly warming climate, and an economy on the verge of implosion.

The racket of war, for oil and power, is already disintegrating international treaties. In the greatest superpowers, we see acceptance of darkness, of opaqueness, of unaccountability, and of decay into tyranny.

The systems that we have inherited and co-created have become unsustainable.

Capitalism is the most magnificent fire that is engulfing this planet today.

We are stealing from the prosperity of future generations, for the sake of consumption.

While capitalism may appear to be unstoppable, it is also just a construct of our collective hallucination. It does not need be this way. Our minds are open and powerful enough to consider different ways of being.

We must each use our voices, and sing out loud with a thunder
that pierces through the fabric of this constructed hallucination, and change the tune of our reality, for the progression of this song called humanity.

Under no authority, and with no preconceived notion of nations,
and rethink the way we consider borders and citizenship,
For all people are citizens of this world.

By fully committing to our core values of transparency, accountability, democracy and environmental stewardship.

If we organize these communities to be decentralized autonomous organization, then from the votes of the people,
the right communities will emerge and prosper.

When the software that powers our communications are free, with privacy by default, and there exists not one monopoly but a vast federation of interoperable networks

When our devices are built on open designs, so that anyone can manufacture them and verify their security. 

When our tools are optimized for reusability and waste reduction instead of profit from consumerism.

When our social services are not held hostage by ineffective leadership, but are comprised of a network of DAOs, where any majority can vote for change.

When we can trust our institutions by virtue of their transparency and accountability.

When our internet infrastructure becomes open and resilient,
when censorship becomes impossible due to the nature of an incentivized networks owned and operated by local communities.

When our financial system is designed to give power to the people and environment

When our financial system is designed to heal the people and the planet on which they depend, rather than incentivize the exploitation of it.

When we no longer need to expend our time accounting for our taxes, but rather we are in control of where they are allocated, in an transparent and auditable model.

When all the people of the earth feel that their voices are heard.

When these new systems work together to heal the planet
and our sense of greater community bound by love, not hate and fear.

When it all comes together to enable human coordination at any scale, united under a common mission.

Welcome to Virgo.
